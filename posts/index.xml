I&amp;rsquo;m Konrad, and the first of my New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions was to resurrect and refresh my personal page.
Since this is now done, we can go straight into my second resolution which is: start a blog.
Why? Even though I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on publishing/promoting this anywhere (which means barely anyone will ever read this), I believe that there is something in translating your ideas, problems, and their solutions, etc.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Konrad, and the first of my New Year&rsquo;s resolutions was to resurrect and refresh my personal page.</p>
<p>Since this is now done, we can go straight into my second resolution which is: <strong>start a blog</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? Even though I don&rsquo;t plan on publishing/promoting this anywhere (which means barely anyone will ever read this),
I believe that there is something in translating your ideas, problems, and their solutions, etc. on &ldquo;paper&rdquo;.
It helps me to structure my thoughts and maybe will help you, dear reader, when you&rsquo;ll find here something useful
or something you didn&rsquo;t know. Who knows.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ll be writing about? Various things, but most often posts will be technical and touching:</p>
<ul>
<li>programming</li>
<li>all the DevOps stuff</li>
<li>Linux (I currently use Nix and manage my full system configuration <a href="https://github.com/konradmalik/dotfiles">here</a>,
so for sure expect something of that)</li>
<li>interesting open-source software I found useful and wanted to share</li>
<li>occasionally I may write about my other hobbies such as cycling, games, books&hellip; hell, maybe even cooking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Posts will be relatively short I think. I don&rsquo;t put any bounds, neither I want to restrict/force myself to write
less/more, but I think I&rsquo;ll naturally go into a short, concise text. I don&rsquo;t plan to publish in any specific
intervals. Posts will appear irregularly. There will be months without anything new, but there may be
weeks where I&rsquo;ll post multiple new texts.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get rolling. I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t be a wasted time for any of us!</p>
